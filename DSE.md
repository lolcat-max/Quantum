Double slit experiment, explained:

How to measure a photon: Mechanism: A solid-state silicon transparent chip is biased at a voltage just above the photonic breakdown limit. Trigger: A single photon hits the silicon and knocks one electron loose. Result: An electrical signal.

Observe photons with a proton (hydrogen ion), If you hit a proton with a gamma ray of roughly 300 MeV, the proton resonates internally (its quarks get excited). It briefly turns into a heavier particle called a Delta baryon.
