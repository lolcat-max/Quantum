# Emergent Quantum Interference from Compressional Pings in Flattened 4D Spacetime Lattices

Quantum interference, traditionally described by the Schrödinger wavefunction, can be reformulated as a discrete mechanical phenomenon within a structured vacuum. This paper proposes that 4D spacetime is effectively compressed into a 2D lattice superstructure, where "compressional pings"—longitudinal impulses—propagate and interact. This framework suggests that the probability distributions observed in interference patterns are emergent consequences of the discrete geometry and vibrational dynamics of the underlying spacetime manifold.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5]

## Theoretical Framework: Dimensional Compression

The model posits that 4D spacetime is not a continuous manifold but a compressed, discrete structure effectively reduced to a 2D lattice. This "flattening" may be understood through holographic projection, where 4D volumetric information is encoded on a 2D substrate. In this state, the lattice acts as a "superstructure," a fundamental grid that dictates the propagation of all fields. Unlike standard relativity where space is smooth, this lattice geometry imposes a minimum length scale and a discrete symmetry that governs interaction.[^6][^2][^3][^4][^5][^1]

## Dynamics of Compressional Pings

The primary mode of excitation on this 2D lattice is the "compressional ping," a longitudinal impulse analogous to a phonon in a crystal. These pings represent local density fluctuations in the spacetime substrate rather than transverse ripples. As these impulses travel through the 2D lattice, they are constrained by the grid's topology, leading to collective oscillations. The interaction of these pings creates interference zones where lattice densities either reinforce or cancel one another, mimicking the superposition principle of quantum mechanics.[^3][^5]

## Origin of Interference Patterns

| Feature | Traditional Quantum View | Lattice Compression Model |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Medium** | Abstract Hilbert Space | 2D Spacetime Lattice [^3][^4] |
| **Excitation** | Probability Wave (Wavefunction) | Compressional Ping (Longitudinal) [^5] |
| **Dimensionality** | 3D+1 Continuous | Compressed 4D/2D Flattened [^1][^2] |
| **Mechanism** | Superposition of States | Mechanical Lattice Interference [^5] |

Interference patterns arise when compressional pings from multiple sources—or split paths—converge on the lattice superstructure. Because the lattice is "compressed flat," these pings are forced into 2D interactions that naturally generate moiré-like patterns. These patterns correspond exactly to the high-probability and low-probability regions seen in double-slit experiments. In this view, "waves" are simply the macro-scale observation of countless discrete pings resolving through the lattice's geometry.[^7][^8][^5][^3]

## Implications and Observability

This model suggests that quantum behavior may have a "mechanical" origin detectable at the Planck scale. If spacetime is a lattice, high-energy particle interactions should exhibit moiré artifacts or "lattice-mismatch" interference that deviates from standard continuous predictions. Furthermore, the π-phase shifts observed in certain 2D materials under quantum interference provide a physical analog for how these spacetime pings might behave. Future experiments using tetrahedral clock arrays or high-precision interferometry may detect the underlying 2D periodicity of the compressed vacuum.[^9][^10][^11][^3]
