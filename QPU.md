Chromium(III) acetylacetonate dissolved in organic solvents such as ethanol or acetone can generally retain its quantum coherence properties, including spin and vibrational coherence, at room temperature. Quantum spin liquid: coherence time is in the range of ~200 ns to 1 μs. Up to 60 meters...

It's possible to fill a hose with a cheap quantum spin fluid and split it into 4 ends, then measure the spins in the center.

I am thinking maybe quantum gate matrices can be topologically structured in H-shaped or X shaped, etc quantum spin liquid ensembles...

You could set the rotation frequencies and measure the lone rotation frequency to do quantum computation.
