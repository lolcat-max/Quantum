A quantum computer consists of teleporting energy losses in an array with gates to control the sink. It requires quantized energy levels enough so any number of gates emits energy when coded, where the hamiltonian is collected. As for performance:

128 qubits can transitively XOR linearly with a surface code. Do you need qubits to control qubits? Bridge using quantum field conduits at various energy levels, yes. Annealing vs digital? Quantum logic pushes the energy constraints around using matricies.
