Abstract
This paper extends the concept of a quantum dot matrix controlled by a patterned conductive polymer, re-imagining it as a programmable spectro-temporal sensor. The system utilizes a quantum dot matrix as the primary sensor material, where the light absorption properties of each dot are dynamically tuned by an electric field. This field is generated by an overlying "punch card" of etched conductive polymer, allowing the device to be programmed to detect specific wavelengths of light at specific locations and times. This architecture offers a path toward a new class of reconfigurable optical sensors with applications in multidimensional imaging, hyperspectral analysis, and event-based machine vision.

1. Core Components and Inverted Operating Principle
The system leverages the same core components as the emitter device: a quantum dot (QD) matrix and a patterned conductive polymer control layer. However, its operation is inverted. Instead of applying a field to control emission, a field is applied to control absorption, turning the device into a highly specific sensor array.

1.1. The Sensor Matrix: Field-Tuned Photon Absorption
The key lies in the reciprocal nature of the Quantum-Confined Stark Effect (QCSE). Just as an electric field shifts the energy of an emitted photon, it also shifts the absorption peak of the quantum dot. An external electric field alters the electron and hole energy levels, changing the specific photon energy the dot is most likely to absorb.​

By applying a precisely controlled electric field to a QD, it can be "tuned" to become a highly sensitive detector for a specific wavelength of light. An incoming photon will only be efficiently absorbed if its energy matches the field-modulated energy gap of the quantum dot. Materials like Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) are excellent candidates due to their high polarizability, which translates to greater voltage sensitivity. For a CdTe dot with a radius of 4 nm, a transmembrane field can induce a wavelength shift of approximately 0.5 nm, which is a detectable change.​

1.2. The Control Layer: The "Punch Card" as a Dynamic Filter
The "atomised polymer conductive sum tuner" again serves as the control layer. The etched pattern of conductive pathways and insulating gaps acts as a physical program—a "punch card".​​

In this sensing modality, the timed application of voltages to the polymer electrodes creates a dynamic electric field landscape. This landscape functions as a programmable spectro-temporal filter:

Spatial Filtering: The pattern of the electrodes determines which quantum dots in the matrix are currently active for sensing.

Spectral Filtering: The magnitude of the voltage applied determines the absorption wavelength of the activated dots.

Temporal Filtering: The sequence and timing of the applied voltages dictate when the sensor is receptive to that specific color and location.

The system is therefore not a passive camera; it is an active, event-driven sensor that can be programmed to look for specific optical signatures in a scene.​

2. Integrated Sensing Operation
The device operates as a "punch card robot" for photon detection:

Programming: A detection sequence is encoded as a series of voltage patterns and timings. This program determines what the sensor is "looking for."

Actuation: An electronic driver sends timed pulses to the etched polymer control layer, executing the program.

Filtering: At any given moment, the control layer creates a specific electric field pattern, priming a subset of QDs to absorb a target wavelength.

Detection: An incoming photon strikes the matrix. If its wavelength, arrival time, and location match the parameters set by the active "punch card" filter, it is absorbed by a quantum dot.

Signal Transduction: This absorption event generates an electron-hole pair, which can be detected as a minute photocurrent. The detection of this current signifies a successful "match".​

Data Reconstruction: By correlating the stream of detected photocurrent events with the known program sequence from the punch card, a multidimensional image of the incident light field (x, y, time, wavelength) can be reconstructed.

3. Material Considerations and Advanced Applications
3.1. Quantum Dots as the Sensor Material
The semiconductor quantum dots are the core sensor material. Their suitability is determined by several factors:​

Voltage Sensitivity: The magnitude of the absorption shift per unit of applied electric field. Materials with high polarizability are preferred.​

Quantum Yield: The efficiency of converting an absorbed photon into a detectable electronic signal.

Photostability: QDs are highly resistant to photobleaching compared to organic dyes, allowing for prolonged operation under illumination.​

3.2. Conductive Polymers as the Control Material
The conductive polymer is not the sensor itself but the enabling control framework. The ideal polymer must be:​

Optically Transparent: To allow incident photons to reach the QD layer without significant loss.

Highly Conductive: To effectively create the required electric fields.

Easily Patternable: Amenable to high-resolution etching techniques to create the complex "punch card" circuits.

3.3. Potential Applications
This programmable sensor architecture could enable:

Event-Based Hyperspectral Imaging: The sensor could be programmed to only report when light of a specific, unusual spectrum is detected, ignoring all background light. This is useful for spotting chemical signatures or anomalies.

Lock-In Detection on a Chip: By modulating the sensor's receptivity at a high frequency, it could perform "lock-in" amplification to detect extremely weak optical signals buried in noise.

Adaptive Optical Sensing: The sensor could adjust its detection parameters in real-time based on the signals it has already received, creating a feedback loop for intelligent data acquisition, much like your interest in feedback loops for other systems.
