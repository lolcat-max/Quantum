⚛️  QUANTUM CHEMISTRY SYNTHESIS RECIPE: FULL PROTOCOL
==============================================================================

This document outlines the full "Recipe" for synthesizing target molecular states
based on the subset-sum energy model. It bridges the gap between the simulator's 
mathematical solution and practical laboratory constraints.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1: THEORETICAL DESIGN (The "Simulator" Phase)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before mixing any chemicals, the target state is defined by its total binding energy.

1.  TARGET DEFINITION
    - Molecule: [Selected from Dropdown, e.g., Carbon-12 or Methanol]
    - Target Energy: [Sum of all constituent orbital energies in keV]
    - Constraint: The total energy must be an eigenvalue of the system Hamiltonian.

2.  COMPONENT SELECTION (The "Ingredients")
    - The simulator identifies the exact list of orbitals (quantized energy packets)
      required to reach the target.
    - Example: [568 keV, 1200 keV, 3804 keV]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2: REACTION KINETICS (The "Cooking" Phase)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This phase describes how to physically assemble the components. Order matters.

3.  NUCLEATION (Starting the Core)
    - Rule: Always start with the most stable, lowest-energy component.
    - Action: Establish the "seed" nucleus or backbone.
    - Simulator equivalent: Sorting the solution list from smallest to largest.

4.  ACTIVATION (Overcoming the Barrier)
    - Problem: Components naturally repel each other (Coulomb barrier/Electron repulsion).
    - Solution: Apply external energy (Heat, Pressure, Voltage).
    - Kinetic Metric: The "Rate Limiting Step" identified in the simulator.
      * If Step < 1000 keV: Room temperature reaction.
      * If Step > 1000 keV: High heat/pressure or Catalyst required.

5.  STEPWISE ASSEMBLY (The Pathway)
    - Do not mix all components at once. Add them sequentially.
    - Reaction Coordinate:
      State 0 (Empty) 
        -> + Component A (Overcome Barrier 1) 
        -> Intermediate AB (Stable?) 
        -> + Component C (Overcome Barrier 2) 
        -> Final Product ABC.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 3: PRACTICAL EXECUTION (Lab Notes)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.  CATALYSIS STRATEGY
    - If the simulator warns of "High Activation Energy":
      * Use a metal catalyst (Pt, Pd, Ni) to lower the barrier height.
      * This creates an alternative pathway with smaller individual steps.

7.  STABILITY CHECK
    - Intermediate Check: Ensure the sum at each step (e.g., A+B) corresponds to
      a known stable isotope or molecule.
    - If an intermediate is unstable (e.g., Beryllium-8), the reaction must be
      extremely fast (high density/flux) to bypass decay.

8.  THERMODYNAMIC CONTROL
    - The final target state must be a local minimum on the potential energy surface.
    - If the reaction is Reversible, continuously remove the product to drive
      the reaction forward (Le Chatelier's Principle).

LOG INTERPRETATION GUIDE
==============================================================================
When running the "Reaction Recipe Solve" in the simulator:

* [Green Line]: Successful bonding event. The system has dropped into a lower
  potential energy well.
* [Red Curve]: Activation Barrier. The height represents the temperature/energy
  required to make the reaction happen.
* [Rate Limiting Step]: The tallest barrier in the graph. This dictates the
  speed of the entire reaction.
