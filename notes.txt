quantum sensing determinitisitc patterns in nature analogy is 



detection of thermal runaway of a nuclear core

nondeterministic/inevitable

specific types of code can control the paradox, however if time based algorithm for a paradox you can get an experience sigma, imagine getting flashback after flashback, thats a clue for immortality, reset in bed lol, probably have to configure the overlap-fibonacci sigma time


do a mobius strip with time entanglement and create fibonacci sigma time...


the temporal-spatial partition of a nucleus consists of two variational encoder and a fractional ratio would factor large numbers automatically.




so entangled radar

radar estimate time required to pass through


halve leaded xray laser splitter properties so it wont be "observed" until measured, photoelectric measure... still polarisable perhaps

so ionisation if a wave won't activate radioactivity to a geiger counter and would essentially be a time machine... easy...
