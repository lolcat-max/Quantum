Note to self, it predicts proof of work, yet the time differential must be greater than the work terminator (the promising signal), then it will automatically stop mechanistically and iterate a nonce. So it solves a finite halting problem.
Either causation will save the interrupt or the multiverse will... Alas macro scale paradoxes don't exist and the photon has to flip first, hashing will stop and continue counting until a promising signal. Only predicts a block(promising signal) only while it's hashing rather..
