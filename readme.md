# Photonically Sensitive Charge-Emitting Liquid Quantum Demo

This project demonstrates dynamic quantum coherence and charge emission in a Room-Temperature Ionic Liquid (RTIL)-based photonic system inside an optical cavity. The system converts photon gas coherence fluctuations into measurable electrical signals via a photodiode and transimpedance amplifier, controlled and read out through an Arduino microcontroller.
