## Build It

### Step 1: Prepare the Optical Chamber with RTIL (10 min)  
- Fill a small sealed container with the RTIL ensuring optical clarity and stability.  
- Insert optical cavity components (mirrors or reflective walls) and place diffuser/ground glass inside to promote photon scattering and mode buildup.  
- Ensure container is optically accessible and stable.

### Step 2: Setup Light Source and Detector (5 min)  
- Direct the laser diode or LED into the RTIL-filled cavity to excite and form a photon gas with coherent properties.  
- Position a photodiode sensor either at an output port or side to capture emitted/reflected photons.  
- Connect photodiode output to a transimpedance amplifier circuit for current-to-voltage conversion.

### Step 3: Build and Wire Electronics (10 min)  
- Construct a transimpedance amplifier using an op-amp to convert the photodiode's photocurrent into a measurable voltage proportional to photon flux fluctuations.  
- Connect amplifier output to Arduino analog input (A0).  
- Use Arduino digital pins to modulate the laser (PWM on D3) for active control of photon population dynamics.

### Step 4: Upload and Run Arduino Code (5 min)  
- Upload code that:  
  - Controls laser modulation intensity/frequency.  
  - Reads photodiode voltage signal, monitoring photon gas coherence-induced charge fluctuations.  
  - Performs signal processing (autocorrelation, FFT) on charge signal for temporal coherence analysis.  
  - Outputs real-time data to Serial Monitor for observation.

### Step 5: Test and Observe (5 min)  
- Power on system, turn on laser and start measurement.  
- Observe electrical signal fluctuations corresponding to photonic coherence and charge emission dynamics in the RTIL.  
- Adjust laser modulation and cavity conditions to study and control photon gas quantum behavior.

- **Optical Cavity:** Enhances photonic interactions supporting mode buildup and coherence in the photon gas inside the RTIL.  
- **Photodiode + Transimpedance Amplifier:** Converts optical signals into electrical voltages that represent charge emissions sensitively responding to photon gas dynamics.  
- **Arduino Microcontroller:** Controls light input modulation and digitizes the analog charge signal for advanced temporal coherence analysis and data logging.
