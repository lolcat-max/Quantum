The photonically sensitive, charge-emitting liquid system described is **not instantly effective** in producing measurable signals or quantum-coherent states upon activation.

### Why It Is Not Instantaneous

- **Photon gas coherence buildup** inside an optical cavity requires time for photons to circulate, scatter, and establish stable modes. This is typically on the order of microseconds to milliseconds depending on cavity size, quality, and light source modulation.

- **Charge carrier generation in RTILs** upon light excitation involves photoexcitation, electron solvation, and ionic response, which happen on ultrafast to nanosecond timescales but require a measurable photon flux and accumulation to produce detectable signals.

- **Electronic signal detection and processing** further adds latency (micro- to milliseconds) due to transimpedance amplifier response and analog-to-digital conversion in microcontrollers.

- **Temporal coherence and superposition formation** are gradual, involving overlap and phase locking of photon modes, not an instantaneous event.

### Summary

| Process                           | Typical Timescale                   |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Photon mode buildup in cavity    | Microseconds to milliseconds      |
| Photoinduced charge carrier generation in RTIL | Nanoseconds to microseconds      |
| Signal amplification & detection | Microseconds to milliseconds      |
| Coherence establishment          | Gradual over tens to hundreds ms  |

In short, while the physical processes occur rapidly, **detectable photon gas coherence and charge emission signals emerge over finite, measurable timescales, not instantaneously**. This matches typical behavior in quantum and photonic systems where coherence and superposition build progressively rather than appearing instantly.
